#Floating Point Numbers
#Floats are numbers with decimal places.
#When you do a calculation that results in
#a fraction e.g. 4 รท 3 the result will always be
#a floating point number.

#Strings

#Escaping a String
#Because the double quote is special, it
#denotes a string, if you want to use it in
#a string, you need to escape it with a "\"
